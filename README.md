# Ultimate-Arduino-ide-DARK-THEME
🕷️You want a dark theme for the arduino ide. So here it is. It is simple and quick to install. 
To install it, just download the "theme" file then go to "programmesX80" then "arduino" then "lib" then replace the "theme" file with the one you just downloaded.

Be careful these modifications are not necessary on the arduino 2 ide because a dark theme is already preinstalled there!
